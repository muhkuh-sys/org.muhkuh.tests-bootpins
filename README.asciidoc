== About

This document describes the "boot pins" test for the Muhkuh test framework. It reads the current boot mode, the chip ID, and - if available - the strapping options.
All detected data is compared with expected values. The chapter <<Test_description>> describes the data for all chip types in detail.

The main purpose of this test is the verification of the correct settings for designs with a fixed boot path.

== Test description

The netX chips can probe a lot of connected devices for bootable images. Not all devices can be probed at once, as several devices exclude each other.
One example for an exclusion is the DPM on the one hand and a parallel flash on the host interface on the other. Both share the same pins, but in different I/O modi.
This is the reason why the possible devices to boot from are separated in several groups. One of the groups can be selected at booting time.
The devices in one group are probed one after another until a bootable image was found. This forms a kind of path which leads to the name "boot path" for one group.

A boot path is selected with a number of input pins.
In total there are 3 different pin groups for this selection:

1) the boot mode pins
2) the strapping options
3) the chip ID pins

The boot mode pins directly select the boot path. They are available for all netX chips.

The strapping options modify the selected boot path. They allow or forbid entries in a boot path. Furthermore they can exchange boot path entries or activate special features.

The chip ID pins select different modes of a chip. This is currently only available for the netX51/52.


=== netX500, netX100 and netX50
The boot path for the netX500, netX100 and netX50 devices is selected with the RDY and RUN pins.

The devices have no strapping options and no chip ID pins.


=== netX51 and netX52
The boot path for the netX51 and netX52 is selected with the RDY and RUN pins.

The devices have strapping options and chip ID pins.


=== netX10
The boot path for the netX10 is selected with the RDY and RUN pins.

The device has strapping options and chip ID pins.
